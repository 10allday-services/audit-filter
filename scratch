### Use cases for exceptions

After review, the application

* is not using insecure APIs (e.g. a crypto package is only used for MACs but not encryption )
* the application has mitigations for the vulnerability (e.g. autoscaling to handle a ReDoS)
* the application is unsupported, end of life, or does grants
* the application is insecure by design (e.g. it's a honeypot or pentest playground like [ctf-austin](https://github.com/mozilla/ctf-austin) / [juice-shop](https://github.com/bkimminich/juice-shop))
